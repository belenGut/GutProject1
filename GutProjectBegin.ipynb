In both datasets, more people learned about CCM from a teacher than did not, but the difference is not very large. I made two big subsets which I then split even further. The subset 'comTeach' contains all responses to the high school teacher question in the first dataset. The subset 'litTeach' contains all responses to the high school teacher question in the second dataset. For both of those subets, I created two more subsets, one containing all the 'Yes' responses and the other containing all the 'No' responses. Comparing the lengths of 'comTeach' and 'litTeach' with their subsets reveal that all responses were either 'Yes', 'No', or 'Don't recall', with no null values. Seeing that the each main subset is as long as their parent subset confirms this. "
